Usage for the TIRA platform (cf. www.tira.io)

1. Configuration
check the configuration variable tira_base_directory in config.py
2. Document preparation
The algorithms (both training and prediction) need to know the results of the stanford parser, which take some time to compute.
For this and others, document preparation is the key. Call
	tira-prepare-documents.py `inputDataset` `run` `outdir` training
to prepare the documents. Instead of both, you may also pass unknown or both, to prepare only the unknown documents or all available documents.
If unknown documents are available in this stage, you can prepare them, too. Otherwise, they will automatically be prepared in step 4.
3. Model training
To perform training with Kim et al., run
	tira-train-models.py `inputDataset` `run` `outdir` kim
To perform training with Qian et al., run
	tira-train-models.py `inputDataset` `run` `outdir` lexical character syntactic
Of course, you can also pass any non-empty subset of {kim,lexical,character,syntactic}.
4. Prediction
To perform prediction with Kim et al, run
	tira-simple-predict.py `inputDataset` `run` `outdir` kim
Of course, you may also pass lexical, character of syntactic.
To perform tri-training with Qian et al, make sure step 3. is performed for lexical, character and syntactic and then run
	tira-tritrain.py `inputDataset` `run` `outdir` 1
The optional 1 in the end may be left off. It may also be replaced by a natural number n, to
perform tri-training n times, each time with a different subdivision of "unlabelled" and "testing" data,
such that each unknown document belongs exactly once to the testing data.
